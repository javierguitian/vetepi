# Interactive Apps

Here youâ€™ll find links to the suite of interactive Shiny apps:

---

## [Incidence Rate and Risk Simulator](https://javierguitian.shinyapps.io/incidence-rate-risk/)
*Interactive simulator showing how incidence rate and incidence risk are related, including the effects of entries and losses from the population.*

---

## [Predictive Value Calculator](https://javierguitian.shinyapps.io/predictive-value-calculator/)
*Calculates positive and negative predictive values of diagnostic tests across different prevalence levels, illustrating how predictive values depend on context.*

---

## [Herd Sensitivity Calculator](https://javierguitian.shinyapps.io/herd-sensitivity-calculator/)
*Estimates the probability of detecting infection in a herd given the test sensitivity, within-herd prevalence, and number of animals sampled.*

---

## [Herd Detection Calculator](https://javierguitian.shinyapps.io/herd-detection-calculator/)
*Quantifies the likelihood of detecting at least one positive herd in a population under different surveillance sampling designs.*

---

## [Herd Prevalence Estimator](https://javierguitian.shinyapps.io/herd-prevalence-estimator/)
*Estimates herd-level prevalence from survey data, using exact or approximate confidence intervals depending on population and sample size, with visualizations of observed and projected precision.*
